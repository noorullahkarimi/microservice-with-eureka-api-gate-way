## Project description

I  tried to create a project best practice, for microservice that uses from the git repository for configuration,
 it is very simple project and it is just nessessory configuration.
 testing the eureka, api gatway, configuration and so on.

##  Directory structure

-   `api-gateway`: The api gateway for the routing the project url.
-   `microservice-with-eureka-api-gate-way`: Folder of eureka project.
-   `service-posts`: Folder of the service posts.
-   `service-users-1`: Folder of the instance 1 of service users ( for load balancer ). 
-   `service-users-2`: Folder of the instance 2 of service users ( for load balancer ).

## How to run :

Open every Folder with intelij IDEA sepratly, and let them to downlaod the dependencies with maven, ( if you can not download, use VPN ) now run the projects.

###  Prerequisites

-   intelij IDEA
-   java version 17



### final discuse
As I said befor it is just a practice and for the learning, so do not use this for real project, of course in future I will put some real project in, 
actully microservice are configuration and all the other code will be like the before.
